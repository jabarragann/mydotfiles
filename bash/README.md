# Prompt config script

* The prompt is set up to automatically display the ros distribution if available with the `get_ros_distro()` function. This function won't work correctly unless I resource the prompt after loading ros. The resourcing action happens inside the bash function that loads ros packages. The might be a better way to achieve this.

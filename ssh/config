## NOT SAFE to have ssh config on a public repo.
## Kept here just as template for configuring servers

## Steps to add keys
# 1. Copy public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
# 2. ssh -i private_key user@hostname
# 3. Create an entry in the config. The identity file is the private key that will be used.


# Example machine
Host dvrk_09 
    User jbarrag3
    HostName lcsr-dvrk-09.lcsr.jhu.edu
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_lcsr_dvrk_09 ## Private key -- Public has to be shared with the server ahead of time.


Host alias
    HostName hostname
    User user
